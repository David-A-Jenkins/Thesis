In this folder is the code used for chapter 6 of my thesis titled "Use of statistical process control to monitor the performance of a clinical prediction model"  

"Simulation code.R" takes the BCIS data used for the simulation, runs the simulation and generates an output file where each row of data is the time of an alert from each iteration for each miscalibration-in-the-large scenario.
