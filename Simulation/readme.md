# Chapter 4 simulation code  

The linear folder includes all code and results for the simulation with a linear outcome when we observe once observation at each time t. The edited dma source code is also provided to run the Bayesian model with more than one observation at each time t.  

The logistic folder includes all of the code for the logistic simulation (including the edited dma source code to enable batch updating).
